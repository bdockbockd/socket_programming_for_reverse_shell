# socket_programming_for_reverse_shell

## Topic : Socket programming simulating reverse shell
  - This reverse shell is just demonstrating how reversing shell can be happen with socket programming
## MEMBER GROUP 19 
## Requirements : 
  - Python3
  - socket basis concept
## Instructions
 1. clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/beesk135/socket_programming_for_reverse_shell.git` and then cd into foldder
